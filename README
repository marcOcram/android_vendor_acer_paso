As start, sync Cyanogen Mod sources like described on
http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus_(GSM):_Compile_CyanogenMod_(Linux)
When done, create acer folder on [your CM path(recommended android/system on home)]/device, then paso folder in it.

To build CWM, just follow next instruction:
in terminal:
cd [your CM path]
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch full_paso-eng
make -j[number of cores that you have * 2] recoveryimage

then, when build is ready, you could find recovery image on:
out/target/product/paso.
to flash you could use fastboot (to enter one could perform that combo: power+volume up until see "fastboot mode" and colored stripes):
fastboot -i 0x0502 flash recovery recovery.img 
fastboot -i 0x0502 reboot
